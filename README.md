# SocialMediaMicroservices

## Microservices Overview
### Users
The Users microservice is designed with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles and adheres to the **Clean Architecture** paradigm. We've also incorporated **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** using the **MediatR** library, simplifying the delegation of query and command-based handlers through the **Mediator pattern**. Additionally, we've implemented the **Publish-Subscribe** pattern with **RabbitMQ** for efficient message distribution in an **event-driven architecture**.

### Posts
Similar to the Users microservice, the Posts microservice follows **DDD** principles and **Clean Architecture**. It employs an **event-driven architecture** for communication and uses the **repository pattern** to interact with the database. Like the Users microservice, we've also incorporated the **Publish-Subscribe** pattern with **RabbitMQ** for event-based message handling.

### NewsFeed
The NewsFeed microservice plays a crucial role in our **event-driven architecture**. It acts as a **consumer**, subscribing to events generated by the Users and Posts microservices. When a user is updated or a new post is created, the NewsFeed microservice consumes these events and takes the necessary actions to update its own database. This orchestration ensures real-time updates and a seamless user experience.

### SocialGraph
The SocialGraph microservice is currently under construction and not yet fully operational.
